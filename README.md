# Data-Cleaning-Course-Project

 run_analysis.R is the script that takes the raw data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset"
 and does the tasks demanded by the course project exercise:
 
 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable 
   for each activity and each subject.

The result of it is an 180 row x 81 column data set that I named "averages_set.csv" and uploaded here
