# Data-Cleaning-Course-Project

 This exercise  takes the raw data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset"
 
 The read.me file of the original set  says:
 "he experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist."
 
 We take the original set and perform the tasks demanded by the course project exercise:
 
 1.- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 
 2.- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 
 3.- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 
 4.- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 
 5.- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable 
   for each activity and each subject.
